## Personal Virtual Dressing Room 
Problem statement: On enhancing tailored discovery on tiktok shop

On the TikTok Shop journey, users often feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of available options, endlessly scrolling through product pages. MindWave revolutionizes this experience by hyperpersonalizing the search for ideal fashion products.

With MindWave, users can seamlessly add items to their wishlist and later access them in a virtual dressing room. This innovative feature eliminates the need to compare multiple product pages, allowing users to mix and match outfits effortlessly to find their perfect fit.

The virtual dressing room is conveniently accessible via a pop-up button on the 'For You' page when fashion-related ads appear, or from any virtual shop page within TikTok Shop. From the dressing room, users can navigate to their wardrobe page, which consists of two components: clothes they personally own and their wishlist.

By integrating these features, MindWave transforms the TikTok Shop experience, providing a tailored, intuitive, and engaging way to discover their ideal fashion products.
